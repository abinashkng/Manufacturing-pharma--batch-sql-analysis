# Manufacturing-pharma--batch-sql-analysis
This is a data analysis portfolio project using SQL based on day to day pharma or other industries oriented manufacturing operations.

# Pharma Batch Quality Analysis - SQL Learning Project

## Project Overview
This is my **first SQL portfolio project** as I transition from pharma manufacturing operations to data analysis.

**Background:** I worked as Operations & MIS (Manufacturing/Packaging Officer in pharma and regulatory industries (Eris Lifesciences, Aristo Pharma). Here, I am recreating the same daily operations analysis that how i use SQL to analyze the operational data rather than record manually.

## Dataset
- **batches table:** 10 sample pharmaceutical batches (dummy data based on my domain knowledge)
- **deviations table:** Quality control deviations linked to batches

## Business Questions Answered    
1. Which batches had yield below target (96%)?
2. What's the average yield performance by product?
3. How can we classify batch performance?
4. Which batches had quality deviations?
5. What's the rejection rate by product?

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- GROUP BY
- CASE statements (conditional logic)
- LEFT JOIN (multi-table analysis)
- Subqueries and calculations

## Tools I Used
- SQLite (DB Browser)
- GitHub for version control

## Learning Notes
- **Time invested:** 45 minutes for initial project
- **Challenge faced:** Understanding LEFT JOIN behavior with NULL values
- **Next steps:** Add downtime analysis table, window functions
